MultiprogOS

This project implements a simplified Operating System simulator that supports paging, interrupt handling, and instruction execution for user programs.
It loads jobs from an input file (input2.txt), executes them inside a simulated memory of 300 words, and writes results to output2.txt. 
Done in 2 phases:
Phase1 - Job loading and testing GD,PD,H instructions.
Phase2 - Paging, VM concepts implementation and testing 8 error codes.
